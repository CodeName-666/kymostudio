# Contributing to KymoStudio

**English** · [Deutsch](CONTRIBUTING.de.md)

Contributions are welcome: bug reports, suggestions and pull requests.

## Grant of rights for pull requests

KymoStudio is offered under the GPLv3 **and** under a commercial license (see
[COMMERCIAL.md](COMMERCIAL.md)). So that both licenses can also cover submitted
code, a pull request is only accepted with the following assurance:

> By submitting a contribution I confirm that
>
> 1. I created the contribution myself or hold the necessary rights to it, and
>    that it does not infringe any third-party rights;
> 2. I grant Christof Seidel a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive
>    and royalty-free right to use, modify, reproduce and distribute the
>    contribution, and to sublicense it under the GPLv3 as well as under any
>    other licenses, including commercial ones.
>
> I retain my copyright in the contribution.

Please confirm this in the pull request description with the sentence:
**"I agree to the grant of rights in CONTRIBUTING.md."**

If the English and German versions differ, the German version prevails.
